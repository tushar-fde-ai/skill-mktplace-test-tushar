## Table 1: rfm_output_table
**Purpose:** Per-profile RFM scores and segment assignments. This is the primary output table.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `<canonical_id>` | varchar | Unique customer identifier (column name set by `globals.canonical_id` — e.g., `td_canonical_id`, `canonical_id`) |
| `recency` | bigint | Days since last activity (lower = more recent) |
| `frequency` | bigint | Total interaction count across all sources |
| `monetary_value` | double | Total order/purchase value (capped at 0 minimum) |
| `r_quartile` | integer | Recency quartile score (1-4, where 4 = most recent) |
| `f_quartile` | integer | Frequency quartile score (1-4, where 4 = most frequent) |
| `m_quartile` | integer | Monetary quartile score (1-4, where 4 = highest spend) |
| `rfm_quartile` | varchar | Combined quartile label — e.g., `R4F3M2` |
| `rfm_score` | double | Average of r_quartile + f_quartile + m_quartile divided by 3 |
| `rfm_segment` | varchar | Segment label (e.g., Champions, Loyal Customers, Lost customers) |

**Key Columns:**
- `r_quartile`, `f_quartile`, `m_quartile` — use for segment analysis, score distribution, and customer ranking. Scored 1-4 using percentile-based quartile binning (25th, 50th, 75th percentiles)
- `rfm_quartile` — string combining all three scores, e.g., `R4F3M2`. Use for granular segment identification
- `rfm_segment` — use for segment-level aggregations and comparisons
- `recency`, `frequency`, `monetary_value` — raw values for detailed analysis
- `<canonical_id>` — unique customer identifier, use COUNT(DISTINCT <canonical_id>) for customer counts

**Scoring logic (model_type: 'custom'):**
- Recency: lower recency_days → higher r_quartile (reverse scale)
- Frequency: higher touchpoints → higher f_quartile
- Monetary: higher spend → higher m_quartile (percentiles computed only for monetary_value > 0.05)

**Usage:** Primary table for all segmentation analysis. Join with other customer tables using the canonical_id column.

## Cross-Table Analysis Patterns

### Segment Distribution
```sql
SELECT rfm_segment,
       COUNT(DISTINCT <canonical_id>) as customers,
       ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT <canonical_id>) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT <canonical_id>)) OVER (), 2) as pct,
       AVG(r_quartile) as avg_r,
       AVG(f_quartile) as avg_f,
       AVG(m_quartile) as avg_m,
       AVG(monetary_value) as avg_monetary
FROM rfm_output_table
GROUP BY rfm_segment
ORDER BY customers DESC
```

### High-Value Customers (Champions)
```sql
SELECT <canonical_id>, recency, frequency, monetary_value,
       r_quartile, f_quartile, m_quartile, rfm_quartile, rfm_segment
FROM rfm_output_table
WHERE rfm_segment = 'Champions'
ORDER BY monetary_value DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### At-Risk High-Value Customers
```sql
SELECT <canonical_id>, recency, frequency, monetary_value,
       r_quartile, f_quartile, m_quartile, rfm_segment
FROM rfm_output_table
WHERE rfm_segment IN ('Cannot lose them', 'High Value Sleeping')
ORDER BY monetary_value DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### Quartile Distribution Heatmap (R vs F)
```sql
SELECT r_quartile, f_quartile,
       COUNT(DISTINCT <canonical_id>) as customers
FROM rfm_output_table
GROUP BY r_quartile, f_quartile
ORDER BY r_quartile, f_quartile
```

### Monetary Value by Segment
```sql
SELECT rfm_segment,
       SUM(monetary_value) as total_monetary,
       ROUND(SUM(monetary_value) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(monetary_value)) OVER (), 2) as pct_of_total,
       AVG(monetary_value) as avg_monetary,
       COUNT(DISTINCT <canonical_id>) as customers
FROM rfm_output_table
GROUP BY rfm_segment
ORDER BY total_monetary DESC
```

### Source Table Contribution
```sql
SELECT source,
       COUNT(*) as total_profiles,
       SUM(total_touchpoints) as total_events,
       ROUND(SUM(total_spend), 2) as total_spend
FROM rfm_combined_user_events
GROUP BY source
ORDER BY total_events DESC
```

### Compare Segments Using Stats Table
```sql
SELECT rfm_segment, segment_size, population_percent,
       avg_rfm, avg_recency, avg_frequency, avg_monetary
FROM rfm_stats
WHERE session_id = (SELECT MAX(session_id) FROM rfm_stats)
ORDER BY segment_size DESC
```

## Data Quality Notes

**Characteristics:** Segment names use mixed case as defined in the scoring SQL (e.g., `Champions`, `Cannot lose them`, `Lost customers`). Quartile scores are integers from 1 to 4. Monetary values are stored as doubles. The `rfm_quartile` column uses format `R<n>F<n>M<n>` (e.g., `R4F3M2`).

**Edge Cases:** Customers with activity in only one source table may have biased frequency scores. Customers with no order data will all have `monetary_value = 0` — their m_quartile is still computed but based on the 0 values. Very recent customers may have high r_quartile but low f_quartile and m_quartile. The monetary percentiles exclude values <= 0.05 to avoid skew from zero-spend profiles.
