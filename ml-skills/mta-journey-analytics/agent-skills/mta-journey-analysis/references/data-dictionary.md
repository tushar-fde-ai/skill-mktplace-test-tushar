---

## Table 3: mta_journeys
**Purpose:** Event-level journey data with touchpoints, sessions, RFM segmentation.

| `source` | varchar | Traffic source |
| `campaign` | varchar | Campaign identifier |
| `conversion_journey_id` | varchar | Unique conversion journey ID |
| `conversion_flag` | double | 1.0 if conversion event, 0.0 otherwise |
| `journey_length` | bigint | Total touchpoints in conversion journey |
| `journey_index` | bigint | Position of this event in journey (1-indexed) |
| `journey_touchpoints_total` | bigint | Total touchpoints across journey |
| `conversion_value_total_sales` | double | Created by logic IF(application_decision = 'BOOKED', 1.0 + 0.5*(approved_app), 0.5*(approved_app)) |
| `touchpoint_histogram` | varchar | Distribution of touchpoints by channel |
| `sess_rank_asc` | bigint | Session rank ascending (first = 1) |
| `top_channels` | array(varchar) | Array of channels used in journey |
| `channel_list_final` | varchar | Deduplicated channel sequence, where a multi-channel journey will have the distinct channel values separated by '>' |
| `journey_history` | varchar | Full journey path with timestamps |
| `journey_duration_mins` | bigint | Journey duration in minutes |
| `journey_duration_days` | bigint | Journey duration in days |
| `recency` | bigint | Days since last touchpoint (RFM) |
| `frequency` | bigint | Number of touchpoints (RFM) |
| `monetary_value` | double | Total spend |
| `rfm_segment` | varchar | RFM customer segment |

**Key Columns:**
- 'conversion_flag' - use to flag when application happen
- 'conversion_journey_id' - Unique journey ID, so use APPROX_DISTINCT(conversion_journey_id) when counting how many journeys meet a criteria in a GROUP BY analysis
- `channel_list_final` - If a distinct journey_id contains multiple channel touchpoints, they will be separated by '>' in order of occurrence. Single channel journeys meet criteria "WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(channel_list_final, '>') ".
- 'conversion_value' - when >0 THEN this means this is a converted journey, but do NOT sum this to get count of converted journeys, instead you should do "APPROX_DISTINCT(conversion_journey_id) WHERE conversion_value > 0"
- 'conversion_value_total_sales' - use to flag if conversion was booked or approved or both: WHEN conversion_value_total_sales >= 1.0 THEN 'booked application', WHEN conversion_value_total_sales IN (0.5, 1.5) THEN 'approved_application'

**Usage:** When trying to answer journey related questions to find patterns of channels that appear in converted vs. non converted journeys etc.

## Table 4: mta_models_standard
**Purpose:** Rule-based attribution models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, U-shaped) by channel/source/campaign.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `attribution_type` | varchar | Attribution model used |
| `conversion_month` | varchar | Month in which conversion occurred |
| `channel` | varchar | Marketing channel receiving attribution |
| `source` | varchar | Traffic source |
| `campaign` | varchar | Campaign identifier |
| `total_conversions` | double | Number of conversions attributed |
| `total_sales` | double | Revenue attributed |

---

## Table 5: mta_markov_attribution_final (Markov Chain Attribution)
**Purpose:** Algorithmic attribution using Markov chains. Measures each channel's incremental impact via removal effect (0-1 scale).

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `run_time` | varchar | timestamp when model was ran|
| `channels` | varchar | Marketing channel |
| `attribution_markov_algorithmic` | double | Markov-calculated conversions attributed to channel |
| `removal_effect` | double | Decrease in conversions if channel removed (0-1 scale) |

**Usage:** High removal_effect (>0.20) indicates critical channels; use for budget prioritization. Use MAX(run_time) to fetch the latest metrics.

---

## Table 6: mta_shapley_attribution_final (Shapley Value Attribution)
**Purpose:** Game theory-based fair credit distribution using Shapley values. Evaluates all channel combinations and marginal contributions.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `run_time` | varchar | timestamp when model was ran|
| `day` | bigint | Day number where 0 is conversion event day |
| `channels` | varchar | Marketing channel |
| `value` | double | Shapley value (conversions attributed) |
| `percentage` | double | Percentage of total conversions attributed |

**Usage:** Compare vs. Markov/rule-based models; day-level time series analysis. Use MAX(run_time) to fetch the latest metrics.
---

## Table 7: mta_journey_stats_yearly (Journey Stats Summary by Year)
**Purpose:** Provide summary of important journey stats broken by year
**Usage:** Validate high-level statistics for the mta_journeys table aggregated at the yearly level
---


## Cross-Table Analysis Patterns

### Attribution Model Comparison
Combine mta_models_standard, mta_markov_attribution, and mta_shapley_attribution_final to see how credit allocation changes across methodologies.

### Historic Trends Analysis
- GROUP BY 'conversion_month' when asked to show historic trends of channel performance
- For markov and shapely tables use MAX(run_time) to show the latest metric, and when asked to show how attribution % change across historic runs use `run_time' timestamp column to show changing trends in attribution % over time

## Data Quality Notes

**Characteristics:** Channel naming uses lowercase with underscores (e.g. `paid_search_google`); percentages stored as decimals (0.25 = 25%); some channels may not appear in all models if insufficient data.

**Edge Cases:** Physical store tracking requires loyalty program use; cross-device journeys may fragment without login; micro-conversions tracked separately.
